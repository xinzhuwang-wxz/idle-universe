The group consists of five members: Miyeon, Minnie, Soyeon, Yuqi, and Shuhua. Originally a sextet ensemble, member Soojin departed the group on August 14, 2021.[2] They are praised for their musicality, versatility, and for breaking stereotypes as a \"self-producing\" idol group, known for writing and producing much of their material. Since their debut, they have been described as one of the most successful South Korean girl groups outside of the \"big four\"[a] record labels.[3][4]\n\n(G)I-dle debuted with the extended play (EP) I Am and its lead single \"Latata\" on May 2, 2018. After several moderately successful releases, the group rose to prominence with \"Tomboy\", the viral lead single of their first studio album I Never Die (2022). The song was a critical and commercial success, peaking at number one on the Circle Digital Chart. Their next single, \"Nxde\", also topped the chart and made (G)I-dle the only artist to have two songs achieve a perfect all-kill in 2022. It also made them the first act from an independent label to debut on the US Billboard Pop Airplay chart with a non-English song.\n\n(G)I-dle's sixth EP, I Feel (2023), produced the single \"Queencard\", which marked the group's third consecutive number-one single in South Korea. The album became their first to sell over one million copies in South Korea, and they sold two million copies worldwide in 2023, according to the IFPI. The group's second studio album, 2 (2024), was also met with commercial success and sold over one million copies in South Korea. It yielded the top-ten lead single \"Super Lady\" and the number-one song \"Fate\", which found success despite not being released as a single.\n\nIn an interview with The Star, group leader Soyeon revealed that the name \"Idle\" (아이들) came to her when she was composing \"Idle Song\", her second digital single. She suggested it to Cube Entertainment, and the name was finalized after undergoing internal competition.[5][6] However, the name received mixed reactions in South Korea and internationally since \"아이들\" (aideul) means \"children\", and \"idle\" in English refers to someone who avoids work.[7][8][unreliable source?] Accordingly, the group was renamed (G)I-dle, with the \"I\" standing for individuality, the hyphen showing that the name has been divided into two parts, and \"Dle\" (deul) as the plural form of \"I\" in Korean to indicate a group of six different personalities gathering together.[9][10] When the name is stated aloud, the \"G\" enclosed in parentheses is not included.[11] Following their return as a quintet, on an episode of 1theK Original's IDDP (released on March 15, 2022), the group confirmed they would like to be referred to verbally as \"I-dle\".[12] The group's name was officially changed to I-dle in May 2025.[13]\n\nSoyeon was a trainee who represented Cube Entertainment in the survival show Produce 101,[14] peaking at 20th place on the final episode.[15] However, she did not become a member of the winning girl group, I.O.I.[16] Soyeon also competed in the third season of the rap competition reality show Unpretty Rapstar, finishing as the second runner-up.[17] She later debuted as a soloist, releasing two digital singles, \"Jelly\" and \"Idle Song\".[18]\n\nMiyeon previously trained under YG Entertainment between 2010 and 2015, leaving the company after unknown complications regarding her debut with Blackpink and attending a vocal academy.[19] Before joining Cube Entertainment, she was a freelance singer and appeared as an associate singer with Lim Seul-ong in Urban Zakapa's Canada Tour in September 2016.[20] In 2017, Miyeon had a small part in Lim Seul-ong's \"You\" music video.[21] Soojin was a former trainee under DN Entertainment in 2015.
